### Container

Container is a primary way to create services provided by framework, 3rd party libraries and application itself. Limoncello uses [PSR-11](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-11/) container.

The application has an access to the container instance everywhere in controllers, middleware, API, and etc.

#### Reading from Container

It is very simple. Just a few examples so you get the idea

```php
    /** @var \Psr\Container\ContainerInterface $container */
    $container = ...;

    /** @var \Doctrine\DBAL\Connection $connection */
    $connection = $container->get(Connection::class);

    /** @var \Limoncello\Contracts\Settings\SettingsProviderInterface $provider */
    $provider = $container->get(SettingsProviderInterface::class);

    /** @var \Limoncello\Contracts\Authentication\AccountManagerInterface $provider */
    $provider = $container->get(AccountManagerInterface::class);
```

#### Custom Services

You can put your services to container as well. In order to do that a container configurator file should be created in `app/Container` folder. It should be a class that implements `ContainerConfiguratorInterface`.

Here is an example,


```php
use Limoncello\Contracts\Application\ContainerConfiguratorInterface;
use Limoncello\Contracts\Container\ContainerInterface as LimoncelloContainerInterface;
use Limoncello\Contracts\Settings\SettingsProviderInterface;
use Psr\Container\ContainerInterface as PsrContainerInterface;
use Settings\SomeSettings;

class CustomConfigurator implements ContainerConfiguratorInterface
{
    public static function configureContainer(LimoncelloContainerInterface $container): void
    {
        $container[SomeInterface::class] = function (PsrContainerInterface $container) {
            $settings = $container->get(SettingsProviderInterface::class)->get(SomeSettings::class);
            $data     = $settings[SomeSettings::KEY_SOME_VALUE];
            
            // use settings $data to create and configure a resource
            $resource = ...;

            return $resource;
        };
        
        // you can add to $container as many items as you need
    }
}
```

Then you can have an instance of `SomeInterface` anywhere in the application

```php
    /** @var \Psr\Container\ContainerInterface $container */
    $container = ...;

    $yourService = $container->get(SomeInterface::class);
```

#### Override Service

A nice thing about using container is that any service (3rd party or even framework's one) could be replaced with custom implementation. A first thought would be adding a new container configurator. However the order of loading container configurators is not guaranteed so how can we be sure it will be executed last? In order to do that we override method `Application::configureContainer`

```php
    // \App\Application::configureContainer

    /**
     * @inheritdoc
     */
    protected function configureContainer(
        LimoncelloContainerInterface $container,
        array $globalConfigurators = null,
        array $routeConfigurators = null
    ): void {
        parent::configureContainer($container, $globalConfigurators, $routeConfigurators);
        
        // now we are sure that all configurators are executed so we can override the services

        ApplicationSettings::configureContainer($container);
    }
```

Please note method `ApplicationSettings::configureContainer` is not located in the default container directory otherwise it will be executed twice.

#### Command Containers

Limoncello has support for command line (CLI) commands such as database migrations and data seeding. Such commands might require specific services to be configured in container (e.g. fake data generators). One way of adding such services is using ordinary configurators in container folder. However, there is a possibility to optimize service loading and have them added only when the commands are executed. It could be done with a help of `CommandRoutesTrait` trait in routes file.

An example of how to add container configurator to database command `l:db`

```php
use Limoncello\Application\Commands\DataCommand;
use Limoncello\Commands\CommandRoutesTrait;
use Limoncello\Contracts\Routing\GroupInterface;

class Routes implements RoutesConfiguratorInterface
{
    use FluteRoutesTrait, CommandRoutesTrait;

    public static function configureRoutes(GroupInterface $routes): void
    {
        ...
    
        $configurator = ...; // callable to `ContainerConfiguratorInterface::configureContainer`
        self::commandContainer($routes, DataCommand::NAME, $configurator);
    }
}
```
