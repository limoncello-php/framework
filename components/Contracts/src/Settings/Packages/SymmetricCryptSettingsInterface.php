     * Appendix A: Padding
     * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     * For the ECB, CBC, and CFB modes, the plaintext must be a sequence of one or more complete
     * data blocks (or, for CFB mode, data segments). In other words, for these three modes, the total
     * number of bits in the plaintext must be a positive multiple of the block (or segment) size.
     * If the data string to be encrypted does not initially satisfy this property, then the formatting of the
     * plaintext must entail an increase in the number of bits. A common way to achieve the necessary
     * increase is to append some extra bits, called padding, to the trailing end of the data string as the
     * last step in the formatting of the plaintext. An example of a padding method is to append a
     * single ‘1’ bit to the data string and then to pad the resulting string by as few ‘0’ bits, possibly
     * none, as are necessary to complete the final block (segment). Other methods may be used; in
     * general, the formatting of the plaintext is outside the scope of this recommendation.
     * For the above padding method, the padding bits can be removed unambiguously, provided the
     * receiver can determine that the message is indeed padded. One way to ensure that the receiver
     * does not mistakenly remove bits from an unpadded message is to require the sender to pad every
     * message, including messages in which the final block (segment) is already complete. For such
     * messages, an entire block (segment) of padding is appended. Alternatively, such messages can
     * be sent without padding if, for every message, the existence of padding can be reliably inferred,
     * e.g., from a message length indicator.
