#### Philosophy
Limoncello is a PHP micro-framework built with ideas of flexibility, modularity and performance. It does not try to reinvent the wheel but takes brilliant components such as [Zend Diactoros](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros), [Pimple](http://pimple.sensiolabs.org/) and others and combines them for speed and flexibility.
